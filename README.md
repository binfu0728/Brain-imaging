# image_process
# **aggreCount**: core code of spot detection
# **analysis_beta2**: code for Ru to do image process and analysis at the same time
# **coIncidence: code** for checking coincidence between channels
# **gaussianFit**: 2D gaussian fitting for spots (not used in aggreCount and analysis_beta2, which only use centroid fitting for finding position of tiny spots)
